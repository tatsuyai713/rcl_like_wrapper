# LWRCL (Lightweight rclcpp Compatible Library) 

This repository provides build scripts and samples for Fast DDS, designed to be compatible with ROS 2 topics. It serves as a bridge for developers looking to integrate Fast DDS with ROS 2 ecosystems, ensuring seamless communication and interoperability between systems using these technologies.

This library provides a simplified API similar to ROS 2's rclcpp for working with Fast DDS, enabling easier integration and management of nodes, publishers, subscribers, and timers within the Fast DDS ecosystem.

And also, this library enable to implement ROS 2 compatible applications with Fast DDS on lightweight SBCs such as Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- **Fast DDS Build Scripts:** Simplify the process of installing and setting up Fast DDS on Ubuntu/Debian systems.
- **ROS 2 Compatible Topics:** Includes samples that demonstrate how to publish and subscribe to ROS 2 topics using Fast DDS, facilitating integration into existing ROS 2 projects.
- **ROS Compatible Libraries:** Offers support for building and installing libraries crucial for ROS compatibility, such as yaml-cpp, ROS data types, and tf2.
- **lwrcl:** Please read `lwrcl/README.md`.
